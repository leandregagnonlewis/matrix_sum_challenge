**MATRIX SUM CHALLENGE**
____

My solution to this /r/dailyprogrammer  [challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/oirb5v/20210712_challenge_398_difficult_matrix_sum/)

I used a greedy approach which do not use backtracking but is instead inspired by dynamic programming.
This approach solves the 20x20 problem but can't solve the 97x97 in reasonable time. Better solutions using 
linear optimization have been proposed and can be found on the reddit thread.
